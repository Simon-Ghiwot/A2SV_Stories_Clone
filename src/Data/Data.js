      "I heard about Africa to Silicon Valley from my friends and I was excited to join. Before joining A2SV I dreamt about solving real-world problems and attaining something that I could focus on and make myself better from it. At that time, it is safe to say, I knew very little about data structure and algorithms. It was because of the A2SV program that I got comfortable with algorithms. From the program, students also learn about improving communication skills and being confident besides acquiring problem-solving skills.",

      "I believe I would have not made it to Google if not for A2SV. In fact, I would not have got this far if it wasn't for A2SV. I don't even think we would have such type of opportunities if it was not for this organization. Previously, I used to think working at FAANG was impossible for us but A2SV changed my mindset. Now, we know that it is possible to work anywhere as long as one works hard and utilizes opportunities.",

I always assumed that I had to graduate from a well-known university in the United States or Europe.",

The best thing about Google is there is something new to learn every day. I would like to contribute to Africa by mitigating natural disasters using AI/machine learning. If we know ahead of time, that some natural disasters can happen, we can minimize the damage they can cause. One good example is Google's flood forecasting initiative.
